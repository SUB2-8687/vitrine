# EXPERIMENTAL app-local WireGuard / proxy

**Routes the inspected Spotify paths through the tunnel/proxy and blocks
installed guarded paths when it cannot. It is not a leak-proof or device-wide
VPN.** Do not use this experimental feature as a security boundary for all
traffic from the app or device.

`WIREGUARD=0` (also unset) excludes its sources, Go archive, extra frameworks,
license resource and Mod Settings row. Ordinary builds do not require Go.
Mode changes invalidate the link output without recompiling the settings source;
default → enabled → default works without cleaning, retaining the output path
used by `make quick`. A default build **drops all enforcement despite any saved runtime opt-in**.

When compiled in, it remains off until the user imports a profile or saves a
proxy, explicitly enables it, then restarts. Import never enables it. It applies
to both Vitrine looks. Proxy routing needs iOS 17+ and the Network.framework
proxy APIs; Vitrine's ordinary deployment floor is unchanged.

## Ownership and readiness

`Shared/WireGuard/SGWGCore.m` owns the launch state, Keychain, listener and
Foundation hooks. `SGWGAdmission.m` validates the inspected build/images.
`SGWGNative.m` installs Spotify-image import guards through `Core/SGRebind`.
`SGWGTransport.m` observes delegates, without enforcing routing.
`SGWGSettingsController.m` owns the form/recovery notice; `App/ModSettings.x`
only supplies its row. No audio/render-thread hooks or logging are added.

A saved opt-in arms the feature **before** checking capabilities. Installed
guards remain armed even if another guard cannot install. Readiness is
published atomically only after session guards, native-slot completeness,
version/build/both image UUIDs, proxy APIs and engine/proxy startup pass.
An absent or deferred native slot prevents readiness. The extended rebinder
counts every matching slot. Permitted `sendto`/`sendmsg` traffic calls the captured
predecessor, preserving Connect's multicast relay in either installation order.
The rebinder recognizes registered call-through chains on readiness refresh;
the existing `SGRebindImport` wrapper retains its other callers' behavior.
Image add/remove callbacks revoke readiness, then
recheck on the serial utility queue. Deferred slots are rechecked periodically.
This does not intercept pre-initializer traffic or make dyld updates a
transaction with arbitrary app traffic.

Guards that can install without newer proxy APIs continue denying on
unsupported systems. An unhookable entry point is **not** magically protected:
the UI reports incomplete guards, not a working VPN.

The UI distinguishes inspected-path guards installed, engine started, and
handshake age (no handshake means health unconfirmed). Engine startup alone is
not evidence of a healthy tunnel. A recovery notice offers **Turn off in-app
VPN**, effective next launch; it does not disable current enforcement and is
not relied on for enforcement.

## Hook inventory and failure boundary

All hooks below are omitted when runtime opt-in is off.

| Owner / entry | Routing or denial |
| --- | --- |
| Core: `+[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration]`, `ephemeralSessionConfiguration`, `backgroundSessionConfigurationWithIdentifier:` | Apply proxy with failover disabled and local-address/availability URL protocols. Missing proxy APIs or unavailable readiness blocks covered web loads. Background transfers run outside URLProtocol and are **not covered**. |
| Core: `+[NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:]`, `sessionWithConfiguration:delegate:delegateQueue:`, `sharedSession` | Copy/reapply configuration at creation; shared session is a guarded replacement. |
| Core: `-[NSURLSession initWithConfiguration:delegate:delegateQueue:delegateDispatchQueue:]` and its actual local-session implementation | Reapply to the designated initializer's copied configuration, preserving delegates/queues and raw init ownership. Full return/argument encodings must match. |
| Core: `+[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:]`, `dataWithContentsOfURL:options:error:`, applicable real class-cluster `initWithContentsOfURL:` / `initWithContentsOfURL:options:error:` implementations | HTTP(S) uses a guarded session. Non-web URLs preserve original behavior. Preserve mutable results, init ownership and errors. Main-thread or armed-unavailable loads fail immediately. Background synchronous loads have one eight-second deadline, independent completion queue, synchronized terminal state and cancellation on timeout. Do not call synchronous loading APIs from a render thread. |
| Core: `-[NSMutableURLRequest setAssumesHTTP3Capable:]`, `-[NSURLRequest assumesHTTP3Capable]` | Force false only with matching full ABI, including BOOL argument/return. TCP proxying does not carry QUIC. |
| Core: local-address URL protocol | Reject HTTP(S) literal IPs, localhost/`.localhost`/`.local` names that CFNetwork might exempt. This lexical check is **not an SSRF boundary**. |
| Native: imported `nw_connection_create` in Spotify and SpotifyShared | Copy TCP parameters, attach non-failover proxy context, preserve original endpoint and TLS identity. Unready, non-TCP or missing APIs use a denied loopback endpoint, not the requested remote address. Local discovery is exempt. |
| Native: imported `getaddrinfo` | Remote names use tunnel DNS only when usable; otherwise fail. Numeric/local names retain the original resolver. External-proxy mode has no engine DNS and denies remote-name lookup. |
| Native: imported `connect` | **Deny all remote BSD TCP/UDP**, including while the tunnel is healthy. No caller-fd SOCKS handshake, flag mutation or relay remains. Invalid sockaddr lengths return `EINVAL`. Local destinations retain original behavior. |
| Native: imported `sendto`, `sendmsg` | Deny remote datagrams, including port 53. Validate sockaddr lengths before casts and suppress SIGPIPE for allowed sends; failure to set the socket option fails the send. |
| Transport: `URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:` and `URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:` on `SPTCoreURLSessionDataDelegate`, `_TtC26Connectivity_HttpClientKit20HttpClientURLSession`, `SPTDataLoaderService` | Count status/error category/bytes, then forward. Full ABI mismatch skips observation, not routing guards. |

Uncovered paths include background sessions, web sign-in, AVURLAsset,
pre-initializer traffic/existing sockets, imports in other images, unhooked
network APIs, local-network exemptions and playback on other Connect devices.
Local native exemptions include loopback, link-local and multicast, not
arbitrary RFC1918 addresses. WebSocket behavior is not certified by URLProtocol.
There is no system VPN, Network Extension, TUN, route change or VPN entitlement.
The engine's UDP socket and Apple's framework sockets are not rebound.

BSD denial may prevent Spotify playback. Do not add a transparent relay merely
to make a playback test pass; record the limitation until a separately reviewed
design addresses caller-fd ownership and asynchronous semantics.

## Exact admission

Ordinary Vitrine supports 9.1.78, 9.1.88 and 9.1.90. Only
`tweak/Sources/Shared/WireGuard/SGWGTargets.inc` admits WireGuard targets:

| Version / build | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 9.1.78 / 9.1.88 | No WireGuard transport acceptance; rejected by this feature. |
| 9.1.90 / 919002269 | Local static IPA scan: main `fbce22c17e1b3e0d9be866ff9291943e`, shared `2e074234cfc63f0e9255c9881824167a`. |
| 9.1.94 / 919401928 | Fork static evidence only: main `1dfddfa139c03735b9a5fdfa475f4700`, shared `2c12ca8c48ad33f8af6569c084a6324f`. Not Vitrine playback certification. |

Both runtime and preflight validate version, **CFBundleVersion and both UUIDs**.
Unlisted/future versions are rejected. Preflight also requires original bundle
ID, decrypted thin arm64 Mach-O, delegate selectors and native imports.
ZIP and extracted-app reads are bounded to 1 MiB for Info.plist and 512 MiB per
executable. Enabled `make quick` validates the actual cached app before building
or installing, even when its source IPA has been moved away.
Static presence cannot prove runtime ABI, import-slot installation or playback.
Simulator platform conversion does not relax production admission.

## Credentials and engine boundary

Profiles/passwords use `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`.
Locked/unavailable Keychain results retry on a utility timer without foreground
UI; missing, malformed or permanent errors stay blocked. Authenticated proxies
never silently substitute empty credentials. Passwords are bound to normalized
(kind, host, port, username), cleared on identity changes. HTTP CONNECT sends
credentials without proxy-hop TLS; prefer HTTPS or WireGuard on untrusted links.
Origin TLS and HTTPS-proxy system trust are unchanged.

Clipboard-originated profile data is cleared before validation, including
failures. Temporary document copies are removed. No automatic enable follows
import. The parser rejects scripts, unknown/duplicate fields, invalid keys,
multiple peers, missing default routes/DNS and profiles over 64 KiB.

The loopback listener uses random per-launch authentication, at most 32 clients
awaiting authentication, a three-second auth deadline and immediate excess
rejection. After authentication, destination names are resolved through tunnel
DNS; **every** candidate must be public unicast under the engine policy before
any connection is made. Dial uses those exact validated addresses, not a second
hostname lookup. Private, loopback, link-local, unspecified, multicast and
restricted special-use ranges are refused. Trusted profile DNS servers are a
separate resolver configuration, not permitted client TCP destinations.
Endpoint hostnames necessarily use host DNS before the tunnel exists.

Decoded keys/PSK and generated UAPI reside in mutable byte buffers and are
cleared after `IpcSetOperation`, including failed startup. This does not promise
erasure of every transient Foundation/parser/upstream WireGuard copy or of the
live engine's necessary session keys.

Diagnostics store categories/counters, not URLs, keys or headers. Copied text is
redacted. A user-triggered country check displays the exit IP; never capture a
profile/key in logs, screenshots or test reports.

## Building and verification

`WireGuard/go.mod` pins the exact Go release (currently **1.27.4**).
`build-ios.sh` and CI enforce that version with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`; no automatic
toolchain upgrade. Dependencies come from `go.mod`/`go.sum`, never prebuilt
libraries. Use an isolated official darwin-arm64 toolchain with its published
SHA-256 verified when Go is not installed; remove its caches afterwards.

```sh
(cd WireGuard && go mod verify && go test ./...)
python3 -B harness/wireguard/test_transport_scan.py
python3 -B scripts/spotify-transport-scan.py ipa/Spotify-9.1.90.ipa --wireguard-compatible
python3 -B harness/wireguard/run_macos.py --live-profile /path/to/private.conf --expect-country US
bash WireGuard/build-ios.sh
(cd tweak && /usr/bin/lockf -k /tmp/vitrine-build.lock env -u MAKELEVEL THEOS=$HOME/theos gmake)
python3 -B harness/wireguard/check-build-mode.py disabled
(cd tweak && /usr/bin/lockf -k /tmp/vitrine-build.lock env -u MAKELEVEL THEOS=$HOME/theos WIREGUARD=1 gmake)
python3 -B harness/wireguard/check-build-mode.py enabled
(cd tweak && /usr/bin/lockf -k /tmp/vitrine-build.lock env -u MAKELEVEL THEOS=$HOME/theos gmake)
python3 -B harness/wireguard/check-build-mode.py disabled
bash harness/wireguard/check-connect-chain.sh
python3 -B scripts/check-strings.py --sync
```

The macOS harness uses the user's real Proton US profile, copies it only into a
temporary directory, compares the Mac's direct exit with the tunnel's US exit,
checks handshake/HTTPS/ranges/Foundation paths, then injects bad endpoint and
peer-key faults and checks a direct sentinel for zero hits. Spotify admission
and native rebinding are test doubles in that harness: they are not evidence
of real Spotify playback. No synthesized WireGuard test peer is retained.
External-proxy fixtures remain separate from provider testing.

Device/simulator acceptance must use a clone, never the original Vitrine
simulator. Import, enable, restart, country check, uncached Free-account
playback/skip and broken-profile recovery all require actual interaction.
Go tests and successful compile-only fixtures do not certify those outcomes.

Third-party license inventory and provenance: `WireGuard/UPSTREAM.md` and
`WireGuard/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`. The eight modules are MIT, Apache-2.0 or
BSD-3-Clause, compatible with GPL-3.0 with notices/corresponding source retained.
Windows-only Wintun is not linked into the iOS/macOS library. CI pins Theos and
third-party actions, uses read-only repository permissions, and publishes no
provider profile. English/Korean use the existing Localizable.strings table.
